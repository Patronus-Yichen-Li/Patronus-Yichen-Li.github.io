## Research Experiences
#### A model and data bas ed SOFC performance reasoning and optimization method
##### Time period: 2020.02~Present
##### Supervisor & Location: Professor Xi Li, Fuel Cell Research Center of HUST
##### Statement: Publishing a patent based on this method through Engineering Research Institute of HUST
##### Objectives: Combining two main field of SOFC (Solid Oxide Fuel Cell) health prediction and fault detection, data-based and model-based, to reach a better timely manner and more accuracy than any single method.
- Build a SOFC mathematical model with knowledge of physics and chemistry. Keep the formula but set coefficients that cannot be determined under certain specific circumstances within the scope of application to unknown.
- The PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm) is applied to optimize these coefficients. And transfer the model to state space. Granger causality test is performed on each variable in the actual system operating data to obtain the causality relationship of each variable in the actual situation
